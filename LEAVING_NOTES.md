Purpose
-------
This file summarizes what I implemented so far in the FlowWeek repo, what remains to be done, recommended next steps to continue work, and quick local run/check instructions for the developer taking over.

What I completed (high-level)
-----------------------------
- Implemented an interactive InfiniteCanvas prototype in `apps/web`:
  - Pan/zoom, background grid, node rendering, node create (double-click), node select/drag, multi-select move (group drag snapshot), and a basic DetailPanel for editing nodes.
  - Edge support: create-by-drag (handle or linking mode), bezier rendering with preview, edge hit-testing (sampling), edge selection, and DOM context menus for node/edge actions.
  - Edge endpoint handles and drag-to-reconnect were added (optimistic updates + `updateEdge` call to server).
  - Optimistic UI updates for node/edge create/update/delete using `@tanstack/react-query` cache (queryClient.setQueryData) and background API calls.
  - Command pattern implemented (`apps/web/src/stores/commands.ts`) and used for many actions (node move, node duplicate/delete, edge create/delete, edge reconnect) to enable undo/redo.
- Backend dev server in `apps/api`:
  - Simple Express-based mock server with in-memory arrays for flows, nodes, edges.
  - CRUD endpoints for nodes/edges/flows and a WebSocket broadcast skeleton for real-time updates. Added PATCH endpoint for edges to support reconnect/update and broadcast `edge:updated`.
- Utilities:
  - Frontend API helpers in `apps/web/src/api/index.ts` (create/update/delete helpers, `updateEdge` added).
  - WebSocket client helper to receive broadcasts and update react-query caches in `App.tsx`.

What remains / TODO (priority order)
------------------------------------
1) Undo/Redo (complete audit & integration)
   - Ensure *every* mutating action uses the `commandStack` with correct `redo` and `undo` that update react-query and persist to server (or roll back on failure). Current commands cover many cases but need a full audit and tests.

2) Edge routing / collision avoidance (improve)
   - Current approach uses heuristic control-point offsets to reduce node overlaps. Implement obstacle-aware routing (visibility graph, orthogonal routing, or A* on a grid) for cleaner diagrams.

3) Node-type renderers and inline editing
   - Implement per-node-type renderers (task/note/journal) with inline controls (checkbox for tasks, truncated preview for notes). Wire editing to `DetailPanel` and ensure updates are command-wrapped.

4) Multi-select UX
   - Add marquee selection, group bounding box/resize handles, group resize, and better keyboard actions (align, distribute, group/ungroup).

5) Performance: Quadtree + OffscreenCanvas
   - Introduce a spatial index (quadtree) for fast hit-testing and viewport culling. For large graphs, move heavy rendering into an OffscreenCanvas worker and send draw updates to main thread.

6) Production real-time backend / persistence
   - Replace in-memory store with a real DB (Postgres). Implement server-side pub/sub (Redis or Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) for scaling, and add authentication/authorization and per-board permissions.

7) Tests & CI
   - Add unit/integration tests that cover command undo/redo, edge reconnect, server endpoints, and WebSocket broadcasting. Add a GitHub Actions workflow for lint/test/build.

Immediate recommended next steps (for the developer taking over)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Run the dev environment and manually verify core flows:
  1) Start both servers from the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

  2) Open the web app (Vite dev server, usually at http://localhost:5173) and the API (http://localhost:3001).
  3) Verify:
     - Create nodes (double-click), drag to move, select multiple with Shift and drag a selected node to move group.
     - Create an edge by dragging from a node handle to another node.
     - Click an edge to select it; right-click for "Delete edge"; confirm undo/redo in the toolbar works.
     - Drag an edge endpoint near another node and drop; the edge should reconnect and be undoable.
     - Check that other windows/browsers receive updates if WebSocket messages are broadcast (basic skeleton exists).

- If you see API errors, check server logs in `apps/api` (run `cd apps/api && npm run dev`) and ensure dependencies are installed.

- Quick verification command (API):

```bash
curl -v -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/boards/1/nodes/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"x":150,"y":150}'
```

This was used during development to confirm endpoints respond.

Developer notes and gotchas
---------------------------
- The app uses optimistic cache updates heavily. This is fast but can lead to temporary divergence if the backend call fails. Command undo/redo will attempt to issue reversing API calls but conflict resolution is naive — plan a robust strategy if multiple users will edit the same board concurrently.
- Edge hit-testing uses sampling along the bezier curve; it's fast but not perfectly accurate for extremely long or complex curves. Adaptive subdivision or analytic distance to curve would improve precision.
- The mock server's WebSocket broadcast is a lightweight prototype. For production realtime, use a server-authoritative approach with persistent storage and a pub/sub channel.
- Some UI pieces remain prototype-quality (context menus are DOM overlays; consider moving them to React components for better state control).

Where I changed code (important files)
--------------------------------------
- apps/web/src/components/InfiniteCanvas.tsx
  - Main canvas logic, drawing, pointer events, edge handles, drag-to-reconnect, undoable commands.
- apps/web/src/api/index.ts
  - API helpers including `updateEdge`.
- apps/web/src/stores/commands.ts
  - Simple command stack (execute, undo, redo).
- apps/api/src/index.ts
  - Mock backend (Express), CRUD endpoints and WebSocket broadcast skeleton. Added PATCH endpoints for edges.
- apps/web/src/App.tsx
  - WebSocket handling and granular react-query cache updates on incoming broadcasts.
- apps/web/src/components/Toolbar.tsx
  - Undo/Redo buttons wired to commandStack.

How to continue (suggested roadmap / priorities)
-----------------------------------------------
1) Finish Undo/Redo coverage (tests + audit). This will make iterative work safer.
2) Implement marquee multi-select and group handles (major UX improvement).
3) Improve edge routing (short-term: smarter control point heuristics; medium-term: obstacle-aware routing library or custom algorithm).
4) Add node-type renderers and inline editing controls.
5) Performance: add quadtree spatial index first, and then OffscreenCanvas worker if needed.
6) Replace mock server with a small Postgres-backed service with pub/sub & auth for production realtime collaboration.

If you want, I can start on any of the above next—tell me which one to prioritize and I'll proceed with patches and tests.

Notes: I created this summary file and left the codebase in a runnable state locally (no compile errors in recent edits). Please run the dev servers locally and test interactions described above before merging to main or deploying.
